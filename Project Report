## **. INTRODUCTION**

**Digital Image Processing (DIP)** deals with the manipulation and analysis of digital images using algorithms.
**Image Rotation and Resize** are basic but important image transformation techniques used in image editing, computer vision, medical imaging, and multimedia applications.
This project focuses on rotating images by a given angle and resizing them to desired dimensions while maintaining image quality.

---

## **. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Images often require **orientation correction** and **size adjustment**. Performing these tasks manually is inefficient.
The objective is to **design and implement an automated system** that performs **image rotation and resizing** effectively.

---

## **. OBJECTIVES**

* **To understand digital image transformation techniques**
* **To implement image rotation**
* **To perform image resizing**
* **To study interpolation methods**
* **To analyze output image quality**

---

## **. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT**

* **Focuses on geometric image transformations**
* **Provides a foundation for advanced image processing tasks**
* **Useful for academic and practical applications**

---

## **. METHODOLOGY**

The project follows these steps:

1. **Input Image Acquisition**
2. **Apply Image Rotation using rotation matrix**
3. **Resize Image using scaling techniques**
4. **Apply interpolation to preserve quality**
5. **Display and save the output image**

## **. IMAGE ROTATION**

**Image Rotation** is the process of rotating an image by a specific angle around its center.


## **. IMAGE RESIZING**

**Image Resizing** changes the dimensions of an image by scaling.

### **Types of Resizing**

* **Upscaling:** Increasing image size
* **Downscaling:** Decreasing image size

**Interpolation techniques** such as **Nearest Neighbor** and **Bilinear Interpolation** are used to compute new pixel values.

## **. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED**

* **Programming Language:** *Python / MATLAB / C++*
* **Libraries:** *OpenCV, NumPy, PIL*
* **Operating System:** *Windows / Linux*

---

## **. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

* **Images were successfully rotated and resized**
* **Output images maintained good visual quality**
* **Minor distortion observed at extreme angles or scaling**

---

## **. APPLICATIONS**

* **Image editing software**
* **Medical imaging systems**
* **Computer vision applications**
* **Surveillance systems**
* **Digital media processing**

---

## **. ADVANTAGES**
